- 🎓 Occupation: In High School
- 💙 Interest: I am interested in embedded engineering


### Projects:
I am currently working on a project I started called OSAB which stands for Open Source Autnomous Boat. As the name might suggest, I am developing an open source, autonomous, 3D printed boat. The goal is to develop a vessel that is capable of operating autonomously in the ocean for at least a month at a time while collecting data. I hope that this project leads to more accessable ocean and atmosphere research for hobbyists and scientists alike. You can find the project github [here](https://github.com/Open-Source-Autonomous-Boat/) and you can learn more on our [website](https://osab.xyz/)!
